# SCT_DS_4
Task 04 "This project analyzes traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and visualizes accident hotspots and key contributing factors."

"Objectives"
To analyze traffic accident data in order to identify patterns and relationships between road conditions, weather, and time of day, and to visualize accident hotspots and key contributing factors for better understanding and prevention.

"Tools & Libraries Used"
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, datetime

"Key Learnings"
-> How to clean and preprocess large real-world datasets for analysis.
-> Understanding the impact of road conditions, weather, and time of day on traffic accidents.
-> How to identify accident hotspots using geospatial visualization techniques.
-> Gaining experience in data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
-> Learning to work with large datasets efficiently and provide actionable insights.

"Download the Full Dataset"
-> The complete traffic accident dataset (~2.8 GB) can be downloaded from Kaggle:
-> [Download US Accidents Dataset (2016–2023) using the given link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
